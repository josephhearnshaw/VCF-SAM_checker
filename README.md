This short script will check a _VCF_ files ref bases agaisnt the raw _FASTA_ file, to see if the bases match up. 
It will also check _SAM_ file sequences agaisnt the raw _FASTA_ file and provide a sequence identity percentage.
It will do this based upon the position of the sequences/bases. 

Total stats are produced at the end of the output file.

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- Python 2+
- PyVCF, pysam, numpy, and argparse.

You can install the required modules by using pip, e.g. `pip install pysam`.

## Using the program

Type, at the command line, `python seq_check.py -h` for details of each argument. An example input for a _SAM_ and _FASTA_ file would be as follows: 

`python seq_check.py -s ../fruit_fly/fruitfly_77_rna_sortedAligned.out.sam -f     ../fruit_fly/GCA_002310775.1_ASM231077v1_genomic.fa -sum true -o sam_test`

Where '-sum true' means that a summary file only is produced

`-v` would be used instead to specify a VCF file, where `-s` specifies a SAM file.
